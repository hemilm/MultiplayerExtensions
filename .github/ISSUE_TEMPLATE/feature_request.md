  N/A

**Describe the solution you'd like**
  A way to have the players custom Avatar show during multiplayer. It would work so long as both players have this mod and the Custom Avatars mod Installed. Depending on how it's done it might also work for non mod users. Which would be hilarious.

**Additional context**
  The reason why I think this is possible is because during both solo and multiplayer you can look down and see the reflection of the Custom Avatar. So I believe what's happening is that the avatar loads for myself, but it doesn't send that information to the other players. Instead it defualts/overrides to the default BeatSaber avatar you created in the game. 
  I've never really made a mod before but I do have some Unity 3D codeing experience. I'd love to be able to see how you've made this mod and I'll continue looking into your github code.
